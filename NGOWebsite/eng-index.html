		<h2>Hong Kong Non-governmental Organization</h2>

		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>	
		A non-governmental organization is an organization that is neither a part of a government nor a conventional for-profit business. <br>
			Usually set up by ordinary citizens, NGOs may be funded by governments, foundations, businesses, or private persons. 
			Some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers.<br>
			NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, 
			and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on 
			recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious or other interest groups.
		 </p>
		 
		<h3>Characteristic</h3>
		<p>	One characteristic these diverse organizations share is that their non-profit status means they are not hindered by short-term financial objectives. 
			Accordingly, they are able to devote themselves to issues which occur across longer time horizons, such as climate change, malaria prevention or a global ban on landmines. 
			Public surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful - but not always sufficient - proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.
		</p>
		 
		<h3>Classification</h3>
		<p>	NGOs are difficult to define, and the term 'NGO' is rarely used consistently. As a result, there are many different classifications in use. <br>
			The most common focus is on 'orientation' and 'level of operation'. A NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. 
			These activities might include human rights, environmental, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which 
			an organization works, such as local, regional, national or international.
